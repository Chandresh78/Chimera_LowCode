# Chimera Web Application (built via ZOHO Creator)
Introduction:
We are proud to present "Chimera," an innovative application developed by myself and my friend, Suryansh Raj Pratap Singh. We participated in the ZOHO APP-A-THON and successfully created this application using ZOHO Creator. Chimera addresses a common problem faced by college and university students - managing their finances effectively within limited budgets.

Problem Statement:
During our college years, financial constraints can often make it challenging to meet our monthly needs. Balancing academic work, outings, self-development, and other activities becomes difficult when we have limited funds provided by our guardians. Traditional lending options from third parties can be both cumbersome and costly due to high-interest rates. To alleviate these challenges, we developed Chimera.

Application Features:
1. Student Lending Community: Chimera enables students to establish their own lending community within their college or community groups. This feature allows students to lend and borrow money from each other without the hassle of dealing with third-party lenders.

2. Academic Resources: The application provides a comprehensive range of academic resources. Students can access study materials, lecture notes, sample papers, and other educational content relevant to their courses. This feature supports students in their academic pursuits and enhances their learning experience.

3. Job Portals: Chimera also includes a dedicated job portal where students can explore and apply for internship and job opportunities. By connecting students with potential employers, this feature aims to bridge the gap between academia and industry, facilitating students' career growth.

4. Community Groups: Students can join various community groups within the app. These groups foster collaboration, networking, and knowledge-sharing among students with similar interests, courses, or extracurricular activities. It promotes a sense of belonging and facilitates community-building within educational institutions.

5. Blog Section: Chimera features a blog section where students can share their experiences, insights, and opinions. This platform encourages students to express themselves, engage in meaningful discussions, and contribute to the wider student community.

Subscription Plans:
Chimera offers two subscription plans:

- Basic Plan (Free of Cost): The basic plan provides essential features such as access to the lending community, academic resources, job portals, community groups, and the blog section.

- Premium Plan (INR 199): The premium plan includes additional services and priority support. Subscribers to this plan receive enhanced features and enjoy dedicated support for their inquiries and concerns.

Technical Implementation:
We built Chimera using the ZOHO Creator platform, leveraging its various capabilities. ZOHO Creator's forms, pages, reports, and dashboards facilitated the creation of an intuitive and user-friendly interface. We utilized Deluge, ZOHO's inbuilt language, along with Zoho Markup Language (ZML), which ensured seamless integration across both web and mobile platforms.

Integration of SMS and Email Services:
To enhance functionality and streamline communication, we integrated SMS and email services into Chimera. This integration enables specific workflow triggers to automatically send notifications, reminders, and updates to users via SMS and email. This feature ensures timely and efficient communication within the application.

Code Repository:
The source code for Chimera is available on GitHub. Interested individuals or organizations can access the code repository to review, contribute, and collaborate on further improvements and enhancements.

Conclusion:
Chimera, our application developed during the ZOHO APP-A-THON, aims to address the financial challenges faced by students during their college years. By facilitating student lending communities, providing academic resources, job portals, community groups, and a blog section, Chimera empowers students to manage their finances effectively and access valuable resources for their personal and academic growth. The application's implementation using ZOHO Creator, integration of SMS and email services, and availability of the source code on GitHub showcase our technical proficiency and commitment to creating impactful solutions.
